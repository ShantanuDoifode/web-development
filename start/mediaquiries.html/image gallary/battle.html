            <b> CHATTRAPATI SHIVAJI MAHARAJ </b> , the founder of the Maratha Empire, was a skilled military leader known for his strategic acumen, innovation, and bravery in numerous battles. He fought to establish an independent kingdom and protect his people from external domination, particularly from the Mughal Empire and other regional powers. Below is a summary of some of his major battles:

            <P> <b> 1. Battle of Pratapgad (1659) </b> 
            This was one of Shivaji’s most famous victories. He defeated the Bijapur Sultanate’s general, Afzal Khan, in a battle that included a dramatic encounter between the two leaders. Shivaji cleverly outmaneuvered Afzal Khan, using concealed armor and weapons to win the battle, which led to Bijapur's forces retreating.
            </P>
            <P>
                <b> 2. Battle of Kolhapur (1648) </b> 
            Shivaji captured the strategic fort of Kolhapur, a key location in the southwest of the Maratha region, further establishing his control over important territory. This battle helped solidify his early power in the region.
            </P>
            <P>
                <b> 3. Battle of Pavan Khind (1660) </b> 
            When the Bijapur forces under Siddi Jauhar laid siege to Panhala Fort, Shivaji's forces were forced to retreat to Vishalgad. In this battle, a small group of Maratha warriors, led by Baji Prabhu Deshpande, fought to the death to delay the enemy and allow Shivaji to escape, making it one of the most heroic last stands in Maratha history.
            </P>
            <P>
            <b> Battle of Surat (1664) </b> 
            Shivaji raided the Mughal port city of Surat, known for its wealth. The Maratha forces looted the city, dealing a significant blow to the Mughal economy and showing that Shivaji could challenge the Mughals even in their strongholds.
            </P>
            <P> <b>
            5. Battle of Sinhagad (1670) </b> 
            This was a crucial victory where Shivaji recaptured the Sinhagad Fort from the Mughal forces. The battle is particularly famous for the bravery of Tanaji Malusare, who led the charge. Although Tanaji died in the battle, the fort was successfully reclaimed, which was a significant boost to Shivaji’s morale and his strategic position.
            </P>
            <P> <b> 
            6. Battle of Bhupalgarh (1660) </b> 
            In this battle, Shivaji successfully repelled an attack from Bijapur's forces under the command of Siddi Jauhar, who had laid siege to Panhala. After months of resistance, Shivaji and his forces were forced to surrender Panhala temporarily, but he would retake it years later in 1673.
            </P><P> <b>
            7. Battle of Raigad (1674) </b> 
            After a long struggle for independence, Shivaji crowned himself as the King of the Maratha Kingdom at Raigad in 1674. The battle wasn't a traditional fight but a culmination of his ongoing campaigns to secure the region. Raigad remained his capital and stronghold.
            </P><P> <b>
            8. Battle of Jalna (1679) </b> 
            Shivaji’s forces defeated the combined forces of the Mughals, capturing the city of Jalna, which solidified his control over the Deccan region. The battle further diminished Mughal influence in the region.
        </P><P>
            Shivaji’s military tactics, his ability to form alliances, and his understanding of guerrilla warfare helped him win many battles, contributing to the establishment and expansion of the Maratha Empire. His leadership and strategic victories earned him a lasting legacy as one of India’s greatest warriors.

                <h4>Battle of Pratapgarh</h4>
                <p>The Bijapur Sultanate grew frustrated with Shivaji's military advances, despite Shahaji, Shivaji's father and a Bijapur vassal, disavowing his son’s actions. In 1657, after Bijapur stabilized under Sultan Ali Adil Shah II, the regent, likely his mother, sent Afzal Khan, a seasoned general, to capture Shivaji. Bijapuri forces desecrated the Tulja Bhavani and Vithoba temples, intensifying the conflict.

                    Shivaji retreated to Pratapgad Fort, where he and Afzal Khan agreed to meet for negotiations on 10 November 1659. Suspecting foul play, Shivaji concealed armor and weapons. A struggle broke out during the meeting, resulting in Afzal Khan’s death. Shivaji’s forces, signaled by cannon fire, then ambushed the Bijapuri army, leading to a decisive victory in the Battle of Pratapgad. Over 3,000 Bijapuri soldiers were killed, and prisoners were later released with provisions, while Maratha warriors were rewarded.</p>

                <h4>Siege of Panhala</h4>
                <p>After defeating the Bijapuri forces, Shivaji and his army advanced towards the Konkan coast and Kolhapur, capturing Panhala Fort and defeating additional Bijapuri forces led by Rustam Zaman and Fazl Khan in 1659. In 1660, Adil Shah deployed his general, Siddi Jauhar, to attack Shivaji's southern borders, coordinating with the Mughals, who planned an attack from the north. At that time, Shivaji was stationed at Panhala Fort.

                    Siddi Jauhar's forces laid siege to Panhala mid-1660, cutting off its supply lines. To intensify the bombardment, Siddi Jauhar purchased grenades from the English at Rajapur and hired English artillerymen, who prominently displayed an English flag. This perceived betrayal angered Shivaji, leading him to retaliate in December by raiding the English factory at Rajapur, capturing four of its owners and holding them prisoner until mid-1663.
                    
                    After enduring months of siege, Shivaji negotiated with Siddi Jauhar, surrendering Panhala Fort on 22 September 1660 and retreating to Vishalgad. Shivaji would later reclaim Panhala in 1673.</p>

                <h4>Arrest in Agra and escape</h4>
                <p>In 1666, Aurangzeb summoned Shivaji, along with his nine-year-old son Sambhaji, to Agra (some sources say Delhi) with plans to assign him to Kandahar (in present-day Afghanistan) to secure the Mughal Empire's northwestern frontier. However, on 12 May 1666, Shivaji was positioned in court among relatively low-ranking nobles, including men he had previously defeated in battle, which Shivaji found insulting. He stormed out of court in protest and was quickly placed under house arrest, with Ram Singh, the son of Jai Singh, assuming responsibility for Shivaji and his son.

                    Shivaji’s situation was dangerous, as Aurangzeb’s court debated whether to execute him or keep him in Mughal service. Jai Singh, who had assured Shivaji’s safety, attempted to influence Aurangzeb in favor of sparing him. Meanwhile, Shivaji devised an escape plan. He sent most of his men back home and requested that Ram Singh retract his guarantee of their custody. Feigning illness, Shivaji began sending large baskets filled with sweets, claiming they were offerings for Brahmins and the poor.
                    
                    On 17 August 1666, Shivaji hid himself in one of these baskets and his son Sambhaji in another, successfully escaping from Agra.</p>

                <h4>Peace with the Mughals</h4>
                <p>After Shivaji's escape, tensions with the Mughals temporarily decreased, with Mughal general Jaswant Singh acting as a mediator between Shivaji and Aurangzeb to discuss new peace terms. Between 1666 and 1668, Aurangzeb officially conferred the title of Raja upon Shivaji, and Sambhaji was reinstated as a Mughal mansabdar with the responsibility of 5,000 horses. During this time, Shivaji sent Sambhaji, along with general Prataprao Gujar, to serve under the Mughal viceroy in Aurangabad, Prince Mu'azzam. Sambhaji was also granted land in Berar to collect revenue. Additionally, Aurangzeb allowed Shivaji to attack the weakening Bijapur Sultanate, which resulted in Sultan Ali Adil Shah II seeking peace and granting Shivaji the rights of sardeshmukhi and chauthai.</p>

                <h4>Encounter between Shaista Khan and Chattrapati Shivaji maharaj</h4>
                <p>This was during the decision Aurangzeb takes to send on his most able minister-Shaista Khan, to defeat Shivaji, who arrives at Aurangabad quickly captures Pune. This was during January 1660. On his way Khan destroys many temples in Maharashtra, while arriving capture Chakan fort and Kalyan and north Konkan after heavy fighting with Marathas.

                    Marathas were banned entering Pune, Maratha were patiently waited for right time to square up with Khan due to his brutality in 3 years rule. The fortunately, Shaista Khan takes to reside in Lal Mahal, not knowing this place had been Shivaji’s Childhood home, who knew in & out of each corner.
                    
                    One of the spies was in Khan’s army and had obtained permission for marriage procession, to enter on 5th April 1663. Shivaji & his men about 400 went in disguised with procession of bridegroom and entered Pune, while other enters as small party of labourers.
                    
                    At midnight when all dark enveloped over city, only flame troches were at soldier stationed, Shivaji & his men quickly entered the palace by making a hole into the kitchen, slayed cooks. From there, a connecting hole into Khan’s room was in process of making with little noise, but failed to contain attention of maid servant who immediately alerted Khan.
                    
                    Shaista Khan who was unprepared, tried to escape through window, Shivaji already lands in his chamber and swings his sword to cut his fingers. Khan takes his heels to save his life, meantime Abdul Fatih, Khan’s son along with attendants and women flock get killed. This confusion, leads Shivaji & his men escape outside Pune. There a small battalion of army with flame torches attracts Mughal army while Shivaji & his body guards escapes to Singhagad via different route.
                    
                    This was considered to be daring surgical attack in middle age of history ever attempted by any other Kingdom.</p>

                <h4>Treaty of Purandar</h4>
                <p>The attacks on Shaista Khan and Surat infuriated Emperor Aurangzeb, prompting him to send the Rajput general Jai Singh I with an army of approximately 15,000 soldiers to subdue Shivaji. Throughout 1665, Jai Singh's forces relentlessly pursued Shivaji, with their cavalry devastating the countryside and laying siege to several of Shivaji's forts. The Mughal general's campaign was successful in weakening Shivaji's position, as he managed to lure away key commanders and some of Shivaji's cavalry into Mughal service. By mid-1665, with the fortress at Purandar under siege and on the verge of falling, Shivaji was compelled to negotiate with Jai Singh.

                    The resulting agreement, known as the Treaty of Purandar, was signed on June 11, 1665. Under its terms, Shivaji was forced to surrender 23 of his forts to the Mughals, retaining only 12 forts for himself. Additionally, he agreed to pay a large compensation of 400,000 gold hun to the Mughal Empire. In return, Shivaji agreed to become a vassal of the Mughals, acknowledging Mughal suzerainty. As part of the treaty, he promised to send his son, Sambhaji, along with 5,000 horsemen to serve the Mughals in their campaigns in the Deccan, where he would hold the rank of a mansabdar, a position that indicated military service and rank in the Mughal bureaucracy. This marked a significant, though temporary, shift in Shivaji's stance, as he was now, on paper, a subordinate ally of the Mughal Empire.</p>
