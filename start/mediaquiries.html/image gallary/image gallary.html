            Chatrapati shivaji maharaj
            Shivaji Shahaji Bhonsale
            ( 19 February 1630 – 3 April 1680)
            
            chattrapati shivaji maharaj was an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle dynasty. Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom from the Sultanate of Bijapur, forming the foundation of the Maratha Confederacy.

                <h3>The Bhonsle dynasty</h3>
                <P>The Bhonsle dynasty was established in 1577 by Maloji Bhosale, a prominent general (sardar) under Malik Ambar of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate. Around 1595 or 1599, Bahadur Nizam Shah, the Sultan of Ahmadnagar, honored Maloji with the title of Raja. He also granted him the jagirs (feudal land grants) of Pune, Elur (Verul), Derhadi, Kannarad, and Supe, along with control over the forts of Shivneri and Chakan. These holdings were later passed down to his sons, Shahaji and Sharifji, who were named after the Sufi saint Shah Sharif.

                <h3>Shahaji Bhonsale</h3>
                <P>Shahaji Bhonsle (8 March 1594 – 23 January 1664) was a prominent 17th-century Indian military leader who served the Ahmadnagar Sultanate, the Bijapur Sultanate, and, briefly, the Mughal Empire at various points in his career. A member of the Bhonsle dynasty, Shahaji inherited the Pune and Supe jagirs (feudal estates) from his father, Maloji, who had served the Ahmadnagar Sultanate.

                    During the Mughal invasion of the Deccan, Shahaji initially joined the Mughal forces under Emperor Shah Jahan but switched allegiance to the Bijapur Sultanate in 1632 after losing his jagirs. With Bijapur, he regained control over Pune and Supe and, in 1638, was granted the jagir of Bangalore following Bijapur’s conquest of Kempe Gowda III’s lands. Shahaji eventually rose to become Bijapur’s chief general, leading its expansion efforts.
                    
                Through his accomplishments, Shahaji elevated the Bhonsle family’s standing and laid the foundation for the Maratha Empire, later established by his son, Shivaji. In the 19th and 20th centuries, Shahaji's descendants ruled the princely states of Tanjore, Kolhapur, and Satara.</P>

                <h3>Jijabai Bhonsale</h3>
                <P>Jijabai Bhonsle (1598 – 17 June 1674), also known as Jijamata, was the mother of Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha Empire, and the wife of Shahaji Bhonsle, a prominent military leader who served the Ahmadnagar and Bijapur Sultanates. Born into a family with a tradition of valor and strong principles, Jijabai was the daughter of Lakhuji Jadhav, a nobleman from Sindkhed. She is remembered as a pivotal figure in Maratha history, not only for her role as Shivaji’s mother but also for the significant influence she had on his character and values.

                    Jijabai raised Shivaji with a deep sense of devotion to Hindu culture, justice, and independence. Her teachings emphasized courage, respect for women, and a dedication to protecting the oppressed. Jijabai was known for her wisdom, resilience, and her vision of Swarajya (self-rule), which inspired Shivaji in his quest to establish an independent Maratha kingdom. She actively guided and encouraged Shivaji, instilling in him the values that shaped his leadership and legacy.
                    
                    Jijabai passed away in 1674, just months after Shivaji’s coronation as king. She is revered in Maharashtra and remembered as a symbol of motherly strength, patriotism, and cultural pride.</P>

                <h4>Battle of Pratapgarh</h4>
                <p>The Bijapur Sultanate grew frustrated with Shivaji's military advances, despite Shahaji, Shivaji's father and a Bijapur vassal, disavowing his son’s actions. In 1657, after Bijapur stabilized under Sultan Ali Adil Shah II, the regent, likely his mother, sent Afzal Khan, a seasoned general, to capture Shivaji. Bijapuri forces desecrated the Tulja Bhavani and Vithoba temples, intensifying the conflict.

                    Shivaji retreated to Pratapgad Fort, where he and Afzal Khan agreed to meet for negotiations on 10 November 1659. Suspecting foul play, Shivaji concealed armor and weapons. A struggle broke out during the meeting, resulting in Afzal Khan’s death. Shivaji’s forces, signaled by cannon fire, then ambushed the Bijapuri army, leading to a decisive victory in the Battle of Pratapgad. Over 3,000 Bijapuri soldiers were killed, and prisoners were later released with provisions, while Maratha warriors were rewarded.</p>

                <h4>Siege of Panhala</h4>
                <p>After defeating the Bijapuri forces, Shivaji and his army advanced towards the Konkan coast and Kolhapur, capturing Panhala Fort and defeating additional Bijapuri forces led by Rustam Zaman and Fazl Khan in 1659. In 1660, Adil Shah deployed his general, Siddi Jauhar, to attack Shivaji's southern borders, coordinating with the Mughals, who planned an attack from the north. At that time, Shivaji was stationed at Panhala Fort.

                    Siddi Jauhar's forces laid siege to Panhala mid-1660, cutting off its supply lines. To intensify the bombardment, Siddi Jauhar purchased grenades from the English at Rajapur and hired English artillerymen, who prominently displayed an English flag. This perceived betrayal angered Shivaji, leading him to retaliate in December by raiding the English factory at Rajapur, capturing four of its owners and holding them prisoner until mid-1663.
                    
                    After enduring months of siege, Shivaji negotiated with Siddi Jauhar, surrendering Panhala Fort on 22 September 1660 and retreating to Vishalgad. Shivaji would later reclaim Panhala in 1673.</p>

                <h4>Arrest in Agra and escape</h4>
                <p>In 1666, Aurangzeb summoned Shivaji, along with his nine-year-old son Sambhaji, to Agra (some sources say Delhi) with plans to assign him to Kandahar (in present-day Afghanistan) to secure the Mughal Empire's northwestern frontier. However, on 12 May 1666, Shivaji was positioned in court among relatively low-ranking nobles, including men he had previously defeated in battle, which Shivaji found insulting. He stormed out of court in protest and was quickly placed under house arrest, with Ram Singh, the son of Jai Singh, assuming responsibility for Shivaji and his son.

                    Shivaji’s situation was dangerous, as Aurangzeb’s court debated whether to execute him or keep him in Mughal service. Jai Singh, who had assured Shivaji’s safety, attempted to influence Aurangzeb in favor of sparing him. Meanwhile, Shivaji devised an escape plan. He sent most of his men back home and requested that Ram Singh retract his guarantee of their custody. Feigning illness, Shivaji began sending large baskets filled with sweets, claiming they were offerings for Brahmins and the poor.
                    
                    On 17 August 1666, Shivaji hid himself in one of these baskets and his son Sambhaji in another, successfully escaping from Agra.</p>
