            <b>CHATTRAPATI SHIVAJI MAHARAJ</b>  was born at Shivneri Fort, near Junnar in present-day Pune district, into a Maratha family of the Bhonsle clan. His exact birth date is debated, but the Government of Maharashtra celebrates Shivaji Jayanti on February 19. He was named after a local deity, Goddess Shivai Devi.

Shivaji's father, Shahaji Bhonsle, was a prominent Maratha general who served various Deccan Sultanates, including the Nizamshahi of Ahmadnagar, the Adilshahi of Bijapur, and the Mughals. His mother, Jijabai, was the daughter of Lakhuji Jadhavrao of Sindhkhed, a sardar with Mughal ties, claiming descent from the Yadav royal family of Devagiri.

Shivaji’s paternal grandfather, Maloji Bhonsle, was a key general in the Ahmadnagar Sultanate, and he was granted land and forts, including Shivneri, by the Sultan of Ahmadnagar. During Shivaji’s early years, the Deccan was divided among the Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Golkonda Sultanates, and the Mughal Empire, with Shahaji frequently switching allegiances while maintaining control over Pune and its military resources. </div>

            In 1646, 16-year-old Shivaji captured Torna Fort during a period of political turmoil in the Bijapur court due to the illness of Sultan Mohammed Adil Shah. This victory allowed him to seize a large treasure. Over the next two years, Shivaji expanded his control by capturing several important forts near Pune, including Purandar, Kondhana, and Chakan, and gaining control over regions like Supa, Baramati, and Indapur. He used the treasure from Torna to build Rajgad Fort, which became the seat of his government for over a decade.

            Shivaji then turned westward to the Konkan region and took control of the town of Kalyan. The Bijapur government, alarmed by these actions, imprisoned Shivaji's father, Shahaji, in 1648 in an attempt to contain Shivaji’s growing power. Shahaji was released in 1649 after the Bijapur Sultanate secured Jinji in Karnataka.
            
            Between 1649 and 1655, Shivaji paused his conquests to consolidate his holdings. In 1656, he killed Chandrarao More, a Maratha feudatory of Bijapur, and captured the valley of Javali, extending his influence into southern and southwestern Maharashtra. During this period, Shivaji employed various strategies, including forming alliances and using military force, to subdue other local rulers serving the Bijapur Sultanate. His father, Shahaji, became increasingly distant and ambivalent toward Shivaji’s rebellious actions, even suggesting that the Bijapur government deal with him as they saw fit. Shahaji died around 1664–1665, reportedly in a hunting accident.</div>

        The issue of Shivaji Maharaj’s succession was complex and marked by family turmoil. His elder son, Sambhaji, was initially confined to Panhala Fort in 1678 due to concerns about his behavior. In a dramatic turn, Sambhaji escaped with his wife, defected to the Mughal Empire for a year, but later returned home, unapologetic, and was once again imprisoned in Panhala Fort.

        <B>Shivaji maharaj died between April 3 and 5, 1680, at the age of 50,</B> on the eve of Hanuman Jayanti. The exact cause of his death is disputed. British records suggest that he succumbed to bloody flux after being ill for 12 days. However, other sources, including a contemporary Portuguese account, cite anthrax, while Krishnaji Anant Sabhasad, in his biography Sabhasad Bakhar, mentions fever as the cause of death. Shivaji’s death was followed by emotional and dramatic events: his childless wife, Putalabai, committed sati (self-immolation) by jumping into his funeral pyre, while his other wife, Sakwarbai, was prevented from doing the same due to her having a young daughter. There were also allegations, though not widely accepted by scholars, that Shivaji’s second wife, Soyarabai, poisoned him to place her young son Rajaram on the throne.

After Shivaji’s death, Soyarabai, along with some ministers, attempted to crown her son Rajaram as the new king on April 21, 1680. However, Sambhaji, asserting his claim, seized Raigad Fort after killing its commander and formally ascended the throne on July 20, 1680. Rajaram, along with his mother Soyarabai and wife Janki Bai, was imprisoned. Soyarabai was later executed in October 1680 after being found guilty of conspiring against Sambhaji.

Thus, after Shivaji’s death, the succession dispute was resolved with Sambhaji assuming the throne, although it involved political intrigue, betrayal, and the execution of key figures within the royal family.
<p> <B>Mode of warfare</B>
Shivaji maintained a small but effective standing army. The core of Shivaji's army consisted of peasants of Maratha and Kunbi castes.[165] Shivaji was aware of the limitations of his army. He realised that conventional warfare methods were inadequate to confront the big, well-trained cavalry of the Mughals, which was equipped with field artillery. As a result, Shivaji mastered guerilla tactics which became known as Ganimi Kawa in the Marathi language.[166][167] His strategies consistently perplexed and defeated armies sent against him. He realized that the most vulnerable point of the large, slow-moving armies of the time was supply. He utilised knowledge of the local terrain and the superior mobility of his light cavalry to cut off supplies to the enemy.[162] Shivaji refused to confront the enemy in pitched battles. Instead, he lured the enemies into difficult hills and jungles of his own choosing, catching them at a disadvantage and routing them. Shivaji did not adhere to a particular tactic but used several methods to undermine his enemies, as required by circumstances, such as sudden raids, sweeps and ambushes, and psychological warfare.[168]

Shivaji was contemptuously called a "Mountain Rat" by Aurangzeb and his generals, because of his guerilla tactics of attacking enemy forces and then retreating into his mountain forts.[169][170][80]

Military</B>
Shivaji demonstrated great skill in creating his military organisation, which lasted until the demise of the Maratha Empire. His strategy rested on leveraging his ground forces, naval forces, and series of forts across his territory. The Maval infantry served as the core of his ground forces (reinforced by Telangi musketeers from Karnataka) and supported by Maratha cavalry. His artillery was relatively underdeveloped and reliant on European suppliers, further inclining him to a very mobile form of warfare.[171]

Hill forts</B>

Hill forts played a key role in Shivaji's strategy. Ramchandra Amatya, one of Shivaji's ministers, describes the achievement of Shivaji by saying that his empire was created from forts.[172] Shivaji captured important Adilshahi forts at Murambdev (Rajgad), Torna, Kondhana (Sinhagad), and Purandar. He also rebuilt or repaired many forts in advantageous locations.[173] In addition, Shivaji built a number of forts, numbering 111 according to some accounts, but it is likely the actual number "did not exceed 18."[174] The historian Jadunath Sarkar assessed that Shivaji owned some 240–280 forts at the time of his death.[175] Each was placed under three officers of equal status, lest a single traitor be bribed or tempted to deliver it to the enemy. The officers acted jointly and provided mutual checks and balances.[176]

Navy</B>

Sindudurg Fort provided anchorages for Shivaji's Navy
Aware of the need for naval power to maintain control along the Konkan coast, Shivaji began to build his navy in 1657 or 1659, with the purchase of twenty galivats from the Portuguese shipyards of Bassein.[177] Marathi chronicles state that at its height his fleet counted some 400 warships, although contemporary English chronicles counter that the number never exceeded 160.[178]

With the Marathas being accustomed to a land-based military, Shivaji widened his search for qualified crews for his ships, taking on lower-caste Hindus of the coast who were long familiar with naval operations (the famed "Malabar pirates"), as well as Muslim mercenaries.[178] Noting the power of the Portuguese navy, Shivaji hired a number of Portuguese sailors and Goan Christian converts, and made Rui Leitao Viegas commander of his fleet. Viegas was later to defect back to the Portuguese, taking 300 sailors with him.[179]

Shivaji fortified his coastline by seizing coastal forts and refurbishing them. He built his first marine fort at Sindhudurg, which was to become the headquarters of the Maratha navy.[180] The navy itself was a coastal navy, focused on travel and combat in the littoral areas, and not intended for the high seas.[181][182]
